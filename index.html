          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Healthcare and Poverty</h3>
          <p>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The scatterplot shows that there is a direct correlation between Poverty and Health insurance. The 2014 
            ACS data show that in almost all states the low income families do not have health insurance. Poverty rate is above 10% for almost most of these states, they are scatter amongst themselves for lack of healthcare which creates the assumption that with the standard of living so poor, they can't afford the additional expense of healthcare. 
          </p>

          <p>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are a few states like Texas, Mississippi and Georgia that are out of the chart with high rate of 
            poverty and its not surprising that majority also lack health insurance.Massachusetts health care rate is significantly low, its noticeable at the bottom of the map, poverty 
            rate is also slightly above 10% might explain the reason why.
          </p>

          <p>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Other factors like income, age range, obesity and smoking  actually affects the affordability of health 
            insurance. Lack of health insurance mixed with poverty will most definitly affect the quality of life of citizens
